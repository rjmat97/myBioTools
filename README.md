some basic scripts that can be used to simplify repetitive biological data handling


1. compFasta
    this script can be used to compare two multi FASTA files and determine the common
    entries based on the sequence rather than the ID itself. 
    
    The script can also be used to compare multi FASTA files to JSON format.
    
    use -h when running the scriot to get the necessary documentation.
